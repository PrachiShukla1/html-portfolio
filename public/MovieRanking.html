 <h1>The 50 best movies on Netflix right now (July 2024)</h1>
 <h2>My top movies of all time</h2>
 <hr/>
 <h3>1. Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire (2024)</h3>
 <P>The Ghostbusters are going to need all of the tech help they can 
    get when an ancient spirit unleashes a new ice age on New York City.
     And if they can’t stop it, then the whole world may fall to this 
     frozen empire.</p>
<h3>2. Find Me Falling (2024)</h3>
<p>Second chances are all too rare in life,
     and John (Harry Connick Jr.) really needs one in the rom-com
      Find Me Falling. Unfortunately for John, his choice location 
      for a respite from his failing music career is a place where 
      some of the locals choose to commit suicide.</p>
<h3>Land of Bad (2024)</h3>
<p>One of the most notable things about the forgotten action movie 
    Land of Bad is that it features both of the Hemsworth brothers who 
    aren’t named Chris — although the film gives Liam Hemsworth a much 
    bigger role than Luke Hemsworth. The story is set in a dangerous
     part of the Philippines where a team including Sergeant JJ Kinney
      (Liam Hemsworth) and Master Sergeant John “Sugar” Sweet 
      (Milo Ventimiglia)
     has been sent into enemy territory to rescue a CIA asset.</p>
